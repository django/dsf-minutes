### Board Liaison required for the Fellowship Working Group

- New proposed charter: [Re-chartering the Fellowship-WG #15](https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/pull/15), likely ready for review for the next board meeting.
- An important next step is to identify the appropriate board liaison & line manager for Fellows

### dsf-members on the Django Forum

More work to be done with forum admins – see [last meeting's notes](./2024-03-14.md).

### European Organizers Support WC

- Post CfP for DjangoCon Europe 2025 with link to contract
- DjangoCon Europe interval for next year due to other constraints: Jan 1st, mid April (!!)
- We've received no expressions of interest yet, and are wondering how best to encourage applications, or whether to skip 2025 and focus on 2026.

## New business

### Django News partnership

Rough proposal: DSF funds a yearly "slot" (price TBD, but a few thousand probably). Use about half for sponsor promotions, in line with the above content. Use the other half for DSF stuff: voting, call for board/WG membership, Malcolm award, thanks to outgoing Fellows, Fellow highlights, etc etc etc

Board feedback:

- Need to more carefully separate out ads from DSF content
- The board is interested in this concept, there'll be another more fleshed-out proposal based on further discussions with Django News maintainers

### Sponsorship packages

Social media schedule proposal:

- 4x annual for Platinum
- 2x annual for Gold
- No more than 1/mo

Weblog promotions:

- 1/year individual thanks for Platinum, on renewing
- 1/year gold member bulk thanks
- 1/year silver membership bulk thanks

Weblog promotions and social media communications have happened ad-hoc so far, this is formalizing what would happen for future sponsors
