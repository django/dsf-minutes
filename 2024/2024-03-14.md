## Ongoing business

### Board Liaison required for the Fellowship Working Group

### dsf-members on the Django Forum

More work to be done with forum admins – see [last meeting's notes](./2024-02-08.md).

- Considering different processes in the future – rolling proposals, expressions of interest, documented open period before switching to rolling proposals

## New business

### Google Season of Docs

To take part in [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) – discussion of the logistics (Fellow involvement needed or not, interest from board members, payment platform).

### Package ecosystem & DSF

Possibility of a packages working group, based on current maintenance concerns in the Django ecosystem:

- [Moving REST framework forward](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/discussions/9270)
- [We need more roadies in jazzband](https://github.com/jazzband/help/issues/196)

Recognizing the importance of DRF to the Django community, and of packages generally – the maintenance work of adopting more packages would stretch DSF resources. Discussion to be had with DSF Fellows & Steering Council.

Django's official packages process: [DEP 7](https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/final/0007-official-projects.rst) (covered projects: channels). The DEP does not define whether Fellows work on package maintenance / who does – it defines projects come with a maintenance team. It would be worth comparing with how the PSF does this.
