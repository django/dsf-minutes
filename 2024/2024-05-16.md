## New business

### Django Developer Survey

- [2023 results have been published](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/may/10/django-developers-survey-2023-results/), and posted on socials ðŸŽ‰
- 2024 survey scheduled to be run, analysed, and published in this calendar year (to ensure that the annual survey is released in the same calendar year for clarity of information)
- Consequence: 8-9 months time frame for 2024

### Vote: Django News partnership

- Propose that the DSF buy 10 "slots" for $1600 (time frame TBC), distribute them: 2/yr for Platinum, 1/yr for Gold
- We can easily buy more "slots" later
- Eventually sponsorship WG will own this, JKM own it for now
- Involvement of social media WG to cover relevant DSF news
- Passed unanimously

### Vote: Fellowship Working Group

- JKM will be interim chair, will lead selection of members and then likely hand off chair, remain Liaison
- Discussion on the process of initiating the membership vs. the charter, whether approval of a group is dependent on membership being defined or not
- Katie will be the second member for now, with the expectation that the full WG membership will be established within the next month.
- Passed unanimously

## Action items

- Thibaud Colas: Update the Fundraising website page to have wording about what the goal and running total represent, and which donations are visible there
- Thibaud Colas: Update DEP-007 for freshness, listing package catalog, group name changes.
- Jacob Kaplan-Moss: Update sponsorship prospective with new points above (not django-news yet, the rest)
- Jacob Kaplan-Moss: Get back to &lt;sponsor prospect&gt;
