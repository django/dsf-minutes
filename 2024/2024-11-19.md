- [6.x Steering Council elections planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bnmPbfdH18YO47Mo9KNgl04yc-VMaeQVeStVQN2mZM/edit)
- Concerns about diversity of the current expressions of interest - need more individual outreach

## New business

### "Hiring" a security consultant with an in-kind sponsorship

Board generally feels more comfortable with [in-kind sponsorships](https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#in-kind-donors) explicitly rather than translating hours into a financial sponsorship level.

### Proposal: Accessibility developer in residence - push before Django 5.2

- Concern with timeline (5.2 feature freeze in mid-January)
- Concern with financing this within our current budget (and other possible uses)
- Process gap: how to hire the right person who could contribute across a wide range of improvements
- Requires involvement of the Steering Council, which isn't operational (elections starting soon)

Rejected - based on the above concerns.

### Proposal: Django as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)

- Doc: [Proposal: Django as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJRirOFiTVNlXgjzsQZT8pkInN3IGpSKKqoTAgZF_f0/edit)
- Proposal from the Red Hat root CNA, for us to consider.
- Enthusiasm from two security team members.
- Requires specific policies, two named points of contact, long-term processes
- Vote required: do we want to proceed with this?

Rejected unanimously (a lot of process for Fellows to take on, for limited benefits).

### Proposal: Django on Bluesky

Username now reserved: [@djangoproject.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/djangoproject.bsky.social) Vote required: can the social media working group trial operating this account as an official Django social media profile? Approved unanimously.

### Regional representation concept for future elections

- Requires a bylaw change to introduce regions
- Concept of elected board members with non-voting rights, so we guarantee representation while respecting voters' intentions
- Possible overlap with increase in number of board members
- Opportunities to improve upon this without legal changes (regional councils, better outreach)

### Voting: Fundraising WG website content responsibility

Per group discussions – addition of one delegated responsibility:

Wording: "Management of the djangoproject.com website content and other marketing collateral relating to fundraising", [approved unanimously](https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/pull/25)

## Action items

- Catherine Holmes: Create monthly charts for finances to date & share PyCharm campaign data
