### Quorum

Katie points out that the Board currently has six members, which is an even number and subject to deadlock; is it possible to change that to an odd number?

The Bylaws allow this change, but with some standard restrictions (such as not using it to try to kick someone off the Board by removing their seat).

No action on the proposal this meeting.
