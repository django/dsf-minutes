### Contributor License Agreement or alternative

- We're inconsistently enforcing this right now
- CLA or DCO we need something automated to avoid making this a Fellow problem
- The stop-gap for less work on Fellows is to set up auto-reply to CLA by email
- General agreement in principle

[Reference on DCO](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco):

- would need feedback from contributors.

Next steps: forum post

### Proposed bylaws changes

- We intend to write up a forum post for feedback and as a heads up
- To vote on in the next meeting
- We will also create a new repo to amend the bylaws more publicly
