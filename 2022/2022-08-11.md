### Django Membership Survey

Chaim has created a survey to help the board understand how DSF members view the DSF and its role in the community. Board members made suggestions for more questions and tweaks to existing questions. This form when finalised will be sent out to the membership. Information obtained from this will help the board serve the Django community long into the future.
